The demo username/pwd can be used both in “创建身份”(create identity) and“恢复身份”(restore identity).
They're just for identification and validation.

You can also restore the identity (恢复身份) with mnemonic 
"trip arrow ugly width item buffalo pen corn someone fatigue word defense" 

It will be faster to get an identity as it don't need to go through the whole verification flow of account creation.

For the “密码提示讯息” fields, just enter any words, it's just a password hint.

The attached images explain how to setup the sign-in information of “恢复身份”(restore identity).

Thanks.
